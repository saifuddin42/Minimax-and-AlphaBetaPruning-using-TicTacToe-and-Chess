Note, that for faster systems the run-times are proportionately faster and vice-a-versa for slower systems.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
The code is in the TicTacToe folder. To run you just have to run main.py. Please install all the required dependencies before running as well.

### Chess
The game is implemented using JavaScript with the UI being in HTML. To run the algorithms open the HTML file and click on the "Start game with AI" button. To choose between Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning, just change the isPruned boolean on line 4 in scripts\minimax_alphabetapruning_both_AI.js to false or true respectively.
